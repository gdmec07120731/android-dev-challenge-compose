Hearing your pup cry out can definitely put your willpower to the test, but keeping your dog in a small enough area will quickly teach them not to relieve themselves inside. Confinement training is effective for a multitude of reasons. Your puppy will not want to relieve themselves in a small space they can’t leave. Crate or confinement training also helps keep your puppy safe. For example, if you are not home and let your puppy get free reign of the house, they could get into something toxic or get stuck somewhere. Eventually, with proper training, your pup will come to consider that space as their own, personal territory. It will be a safe place for them to retreat to when they feel overwhelmed or just want some peace and quiet. You may find them taking a nap there by choice before long, and they may even prefer it to your human furniture when looking for a resting spot.\"\n" +

The gassy-ness has to come from one of the Boston Terrier’s forefathers, the American Bulldog.Luckily, Boston Terrier puppies are only around five pounds at the eight week mark, so the toots won’t be too ferocious at the beginning, and by the time they get older, you will love them too much to care about the stink.\"\n" +
